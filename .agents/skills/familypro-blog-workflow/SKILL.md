# Familypro Blog Workflow

Use this skill for blog-content work in the `familypro` repo, including:

- Create a new blog post
- Rewrite or expand an existing post
- Translate or localize a post into another language
- Refresh stale facts, commands, links, or positioning
- Review a blog post for factual, structural, SEO, or localization issues
- Adjust frontmatter such as `title`, `headline`, `description`, `summary`, or language variants

## Always read first

Before doing substantive work, align with:

- `AGENT.md`
- `src/content.config.ts`
- The relevant file(s) under `src/content/blog/**`

Read `src/pages/[lang]/blog/[slug].astro` only when the task involves `title`, `headline`, page-level rendering, or article SEO output.

## Choose the mode, then load only the matching reference

- For creating, rewriting, expanding, or refreshing a post: read [create_update.md](references/create_update.md)
- For multilingual translation or localization: read [translate_localize.md](references/translate_localize.md)
- For review-only work: read [review.md](references/review.md)
- For frontmatter, title, headline, or SEO-specific adjustments: read [seo_frontmatter.md](references/seo_frontmatter.md)
- For language fluency/clarity polishing (smooth phrasing, ambiguity reduction): read [language-clarity.md](references/language-clarity.md)

You may need more than one reference file, but only load the ones relevant to the current task.

## Core operating rules

- Prefer content-only changes unless the task clearly requires a template or SEO logic change.
- Treat Chinese and other languages as separate writing tasks, not literal sentence mapping.
- For writing/rewriting/localization tasks in any language, apply the default checklist in `references/language-clarity.md` unless the user requests a specific voice that conflicts with it.
- Write for readers who want to understand the blog topic and make a decision or take action; keep the tone natural and direct, and avoid robotic/template-like phrasing.
- Preserve shared facts, product claims, and `translationKey` consistency across languages.
- Use numbered section headings by default in article bodies (`h2`: `1.` / `2.` / `3.`, `h3`: `1.1` / `1.2`), with numbering aligned to real structure.
- Any blog file edit (frontmatter or body) must sync `updatedDate` to the current date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- If an edited post contains explicit freshness markers in frontmatter/body (for example `as of`, `last checked on`, `截至`, `最后核对日期`), sync those dates to the current verification date and keep wording consistent across language variants.
- If facts, commands, links, or product behavior may have changed, verify them before writing.
- If a post includes reference links, it must end with a reference section:
  - `## References` for non-Chinese posts
  - `## 官方参考` for Chinese posts
- Keep the final localized reference heading unnumbered so repository validation scripts pass.
- Treat locale-specific SEO length hard caps as mandatory, not advisory. If `title` or `description` exceeds the hard cap for that language, rewrite it.
- If the user asks for review, findings come first; do not silently rewrite content unless asked.

## Validation

- After changing any file under `src/content/blog/**`, run `npm run sync:updated-date` first.
- After content changes, run `npm run build`.
- For posts with reference links, run `npm run check:references` to verify the final reference section exists and includes cited references.
- If `title` or `description` was reviewed or edited, measure length explicitly against the locale-specific hard caps before finishing.
- If the edited post includes explicit freshness dates, verify all in-article date markers were updated consistently in each edited language file.
- If `title`, `headline`, `description`, canonical, hreflang, or structured data changed, inspect generated output or built HTML.
- If review is requested, validate by citing concrete file paths and line numbers.
